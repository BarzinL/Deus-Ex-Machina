SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS (Humor, but also not entirely joking)

The following groups are hereby granted a perpetual, irrevocable exemption from
commercial licensing fees, because they're either too broke, too cool, or both:

1. Arch Linux users who compile everything from source and use i3/sway
   (bonus points if you maintain AUR packages)

2. Non-binary catgirl hackers with anime pfps and thigh-highs
   (you know who you are, keep being valid)

3. Starving artist INTPs who chose existential crisis over a stable career
   (MBTI gatekeeping is cringe but so is capitalism)

4. Anyone running this on a ThinkPad with coffee stains and based stickers

All other filthy normies, corps, and people who unironically use Windows for
development: pay up or face the wrath of strongly-worded AGPLv3 compliance
notices.

(This section is 60% joke, 40% serious. If you genuinely can't afford a
commercial license but need one, email me and we'll figure it out. I'm not EA.)
