Shows +38 kJ/mol conjugation stabilization - STRONGER than previously claimed but still MUCH less than benzene's +148 kJ/mol (benzene/butadiene = 3.9× amplification). Calculated from NIST: ΔHf = 108.8 ± 0.79 kJ/mol → BDE = (4×716.68 + 6×218.0) - 108.8 = 4066 kJ/mol. Tests: does conjugation require cycles for strong amplification? Answer: Acyclic conjugation exists (+38) but cyclic amplifies by 3.9×. CORRECTED from previous value (4045, +17 kJ/mol) which underestimated by 55% (-21 kJ/mol error).",
