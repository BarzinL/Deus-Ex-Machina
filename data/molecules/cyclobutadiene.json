Total destabilization ~200 kJ/mol from: (1) ring strain (~110 kJ/mol, less than cyclopropane), (2) antiaromatic destabilization (~90 kJ/mol from destructive π-interference). Bonds are WEAKER than naive prediction. CRITICAL TEST: If feedback loop hypothesis is correct, this should show large NEGATIVE violation similar in magnitude to benzene's positive violation.",
