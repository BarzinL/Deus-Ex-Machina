    "comment": "NON-AROMATIC (avoids antiaromaticity). Has 8 π-electrons (4n, n=2) which would be antiaromatic if planar, but adopts NON-PLANAR 'tub' conformation to prevent full π-conjugation. Shows +84 kJ/mol positive violation - the tub form is slightly MORE stable than expected for localized polyene, likely due to favorable geometry. If forced planar, would be strongly antiaromatic (>200 kJ/mol destabilization). Critical test: larger ring with 4n electrons that AVOIDS antiaromaticity through geometry.",
