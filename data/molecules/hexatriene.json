Shows +74 kJ/mol conjugation stabilization from π-delocalization across chain, LESS than benzene's +148 kJ/mol (2.0× amplification factor). Calculated from NIST heat of formation: ΔHf = 168 ± 3 kJ/mol → BDE = (6×716.68 + 8×218.0) - 168 = 5876 kJ/mol. Tests core hypothesis: does CYCLE topology create amplification, or just electron count? CORRECTED from previous value (5845, +43 kJ/mol) which underestimated by 72% (-31 kJ/mol error).",
