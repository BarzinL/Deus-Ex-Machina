Shows conjugation stabilization (~43 kJ/mol) from π-delocalization across chain, but MUCH less than benzene's ~148 kJ/mol. This tests the core hypothesis: does the CYCLE create the amplification, or is it just about electron count? If feedback loop hypothesis is correct, hexatriene should show 3-4× LESS violation than benzene despite identical π-electron count.",
