  statement: |
    When components form cycles and can correlate (electronically or geometrically),
    correlation is amplified by 3-10× compared to linear chains. This occurs because
    correlation can circulate (A→B→C→...→A) rather than decay exponentially in
    linear structures (A→B→C→D). The amplification factor depends on:

    1. **Topology**: Cycle (feedback) vs Chain (decay) — Factor: 3-10×
    2. **Correlation Type**: Electronic (π-conjugation) > Geometric (ring strain) — Factor: 2-3×
    3. **Interference Pattern**: Constructive (4n+2) vs Destructive (4n) — Determines SIGN

    The mechanism is domain-agnostic: applies to any substrate where components
    form cycles and correlation can propagate between them.
