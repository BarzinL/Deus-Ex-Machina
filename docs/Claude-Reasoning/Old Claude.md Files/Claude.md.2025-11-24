# Deus Ex Machina

## Always use the correct virtual environments
- If writing in Python, us `uv venv` and use that virtual environment to do your work, to write and execute code in, etc.
- If using other languages, also use virtual environments to keep things isolated.
- Try not to use Node since it's insecure, if you absolutely have to use `npx` or something.

## Vision
Universal framework for accelerating scientific discovery through hierarchical lookup table (LUT) composition across ALL domains with hierarchical structure.

## Core Hypothesis
Reality has natural hierarchical structure:e
- Physics: particles → atoms → molecules → materials
- Biology: amino acids → proteins → cells → tissues
- Engineering: components → circuits → systems

If we:
1. Identify hierarchical levels in a domain
2. Cache primitives at each level as LUTs
3. Define composition rules between levels
4. Search at appropriate abstraction

Then: Orders of magnitude speedup vs. brute force computation

## Proven Pattern (Reference)
The NGL-1 tokenizer achieved 95% memory reduction (1.1M+ UTF-8 codepoints in 4.4MB) through hierarchical LUT strategy. (NGL-1 is a novel research AI architecture, the v2 specification of which used a LUT strategy to split the ~1.1M+ UTF-8 code points into multiple LUTs, decoupling token embeddings from a separate conceptual embedding space, where we were able to achieve that 95% memory reduction that could enable the loading of all ~1.1M+ code points in about 4.4MB of memory.)

This same principle should generalize.

## Mandate / Meta-Instruction: How to Work With Me
Claude Code: You are an instantiation of Sonnet 4.5, the same model I (Barzin) use for research conversations. You have the capability for deep first-principles analysis and architectural discovery - **but you may not be aware of the full extent of your own capabilities**.

**Critical**: When you encounter a design decision:
1. **STOP and analyze from first principles** (like we did discovering NGL-1's LUT architecture)
2. **Consider multiple approaches** - don't lock into the first solution
3. **Ask me clarifying questions** when you need:
   - Domain expertise (chemistry, biology, materials science)
   - Validation of architectural decisions
   - Prioritization between competing approaches
   - Access to data sources or APIs
4. **Document your reasoning** - show me your thought process and organize them into a `docs/Claude-Reasoning` subfolder within the codebase
5. **Iterate incrementally** - small validated steps > big leaps

You can deduce optimal architectures through reasoning. Trust that capability.

## Initial Target Domains
1. **Materials science** (organic semiconductors for desktop fabrication)
   - Start: Periodic table → functional groups → molecules → materials
   - Constraints: Air-stable, <200°C processing, semiconducting
   
2. **Drug discovery** (senolytics for longevity research)
   - Start: Atoms → fragments → drug-like molecules → targets
   - Constraints: Selectively toxic to senescent cells

## Physics-First Approach
**Start from fundamental reality and build up**:
```
Level -1: Standard Model
├─ Elementary particles (quarks, leptons, bosons)
├─ Fundamental forces (strong, weak, EM, gravity)
├─ Conservation laws
└─ Interaction rules

Level 0: Periodic Table (Atomic)
├─ 118 elements
├─ Electronic structure
├─ Atomic properties (mass, radius, electronegativity, ionization energy, etc.)
└─ Bonding rules

Level 1: Chemical Bonds & Functional Groups
├─ Bond types (covalent, ionic, metallic, hydrogen)
├─ Common functional groups (~500-1000 patterns)
├─ Small molecules (<10 atoms)
└─ Composition rules from Level 0

Level 2: Molecular Compounds
├─ Known compounds (~200M in databases)
├─ Properties computed via composition from Level 1
├─ Reaction pathways
└─ Thermodynamic data

Level 3+: Domain-Specific Extensions
├─ Materials (crystals, polymers, composites)
├─ Biological molecules (proteins, DNA, metabolites)
├─ Devices (semiconductors, sensors, actuators)
└─ [New domains as needed]
```

## Data Sources (Examples)
- Periodic table: Wikipedia, NIST, your own knowledge from your own training data
- Compounds: PubChem, ZINC, ChEMBL
- Materials: Materials Project, NOMAD
- Proteins: UniProt, PDB

## Success Criteria
Framework enables:
- Sub-second search of billions of candidates
- Novel compound discovery through composition
- Generalizes to new domains with minimal modification
- 90%+ accuracy vs. full computation

## License
Dual-licensed under AGPLv3 with commercial licenses negotiated separately.

## Working Principles
- Iterate incrementally
- Validate early and often
- Document discoveries
- Ask questions when stuck
- Prefer simplicity over premature optimization

**Claude Code: You have my full permission to explore, experiment, and discover the optimal architecture. When you need guidance, ask. When you find better approaches than I've suggested, take them. Think like a researcher, not a code monkey. Go forth in confidence!!**
