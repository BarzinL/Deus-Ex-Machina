"""
Theory Layer (Layer 0): Pure physics-based element property generators.

This module contains first-principles calculations for element properties
derived from quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and QED.

Submodules:
- quantum: Electron configurations, atomic radii, orbital properties
- nuclear: Nuclear stability, half-lives, decay modes
- qed: Quantum electrodynamics limits for superheavy elements
- trends: Property extrapolation from periodic trends
